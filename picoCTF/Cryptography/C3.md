# C3
This challenge asks us to reverse this ciphertext by the given cipher

## Files Provided
1. [ciphertext](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/ciphertext)
2. [encoder](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/47/convert.py)

## Hints Given
Hint 1.  Modern crypto schemes don't depend on the encoder to be secret, but this one does

## Procedure
I found the encoder and the ciphertext so using I reversed engineered the encode to form this
### Encoded
```python
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```

### Decoded
```python
import sys

# The lookup tables
lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

# Read encoded input
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

out = ""
prev = 0

# Decode each character
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  original_index = (cur + prev) % 40
  out += lookup1[original_index]
  prev = original_index

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
2. When i ran the decoder i got this
```bash
palinux@LAPTOP-6CJCK5GG:~$ python3 decode.py < ciphertext
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
palinux@LAPTOP-6CJCK5GG:~$
```
3. It was a python script and as it was `selfinput` so i self inputeded it
```bash
palinux@LAPTOP-6CJCK5GG:~$ python3 decode.py < hi.txt
a
d
l
i
b
s
palinux@LAPTOP-6CJCK5GG:~$
```
4. so I put it in a flag and got `picoCTF{adlibs}`

## Flag Given
`picoCTF{adlibs}`
