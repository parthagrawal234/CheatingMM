## Solve
The numbers are `16 9 3 15 3 20 6 { 20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14 }`. If we consider that every flag starts with `PICOCTF{` we can see that the numbers are just referring to the latin alphabet's serial number. Therefore decoding it forms `picoctf{thenumbersmason}` which is the flag
